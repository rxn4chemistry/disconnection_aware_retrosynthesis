## Usage

- Download the data from Figshare.
- Unzip '1976_Sep2016_USPTOgrants_smiles.7z' which we will use for demo purposes.
- You should have a file called '1976_Sep2016_USPTOgrants_smiles.rsmi' which you can use with our [notebook](../notebooks_and_scripts/uspto_preprocessing_example.ipynb) for basic data pre-processing.
